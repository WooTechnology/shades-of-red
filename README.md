# SHADES OF RED

## Abstract / Summary
The project is going to be an android application. In todayâ€™s times, having a blood donation management system is a necessity. We see people putting up whatsapp stories which are not that helpful. If we have someone of our blood type and near our location, we could send our details to that particular patient. It basically connects people who need each other with ease. What better way than to save lives and do a little good to society?

## Background
During covid-19, we all have seen people sharing stories on social media platforms. Sometimes it does get things done, but at times there is a lack of information, or the location might be far away, or the message might not reach the right people. We do need an android application where everything can be at one place, and we can decide who we want to help on the basis of the various information provided.
